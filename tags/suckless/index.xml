      <description>I created a system to patch suckless programs using GNU quilt. When building suckless programs from source I found that dealing with the patches was confusing and error prone. I therefore made a tool to make looking at patches systematic and reproducible by making use of quilt. This tool is used by Debian for patching source packages which is why I know about it.&#xA;The advantage of using quilt is that you can always reverse the patches and get back to a blank slate, which means you can do git pull from the upstream repo and then reapply your patches.</description>
