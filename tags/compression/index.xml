      <description>A few days ago, I wrote about various compression algorithms and how they perform. Today, I am looking further into the 19 different compression levels available in zstd. I ran the experiment in exactly the same way, using the same cpio archive and the same computer.&#xA;zstd has 19 different compression levels, and in the experiment detailed below they are named &amp;ldquo;zstd-1&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;zstd-2&amp;rdquo;, etc. up to &amp;ldquo;zstd-19&amp;rdquo;. For purposes of comparison, I have included results from gzip, bzip2 and xz from last time.</description>

      <description>Today I tested out various compression programs that are available on macOS/Linux.&#xA;The compression programs used TL;DR: Never mind, take me to Results!&#xA;GNU gzip GNU Gzip is the most used and loved compression program in the Linux/macOS world. Originally written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler for the GNU project. It has been the standard compression program used for many years in the open source community, and is a well established standard, not least for tar.</description>
