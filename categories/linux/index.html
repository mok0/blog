          This is the writeup of a new utility I have written, inspired by Pywal. You can find it on Codeberg.
This project is heavily inspired by Dylan Araps&rsquo; Pywal application. Dylan archived the github repository in April 2024, it has since been forked by github user eylles and expanded for 16 colors in the project Pywal16.
However I found that Pywal16 gave me two sets of identical colors, not 16 unique.

          I created a system to patch suckless programs using GNU quilt. When building suckless programs from source I found that dealing with the patches was confusing and error prone. I therefore made a tool to make looking at patches systematic and reproducible by making use of quilt. This tool is used by Debian for patching source packages which is why I know about it.
The advantage of using quilt is that you can always reverse the patches and get back to a blank slate, which means you can do git pull from the upstream repo and then reapply your patches.

          A few days ago, I wrote about various compression algorithms and how they perform. Today, I am looking further into the 19 different compression levels available in zstd. I ran the experiment in exactly the same way, using the same cpio archive and the same computer.
zstd has 19 different compression levels, and in the experiment detailed below they are named &ldquo;zstd-1&rdquo;, &ldquo;zstd-2&rdquo;, etc. up to &ldquo;zstd-19&rdquo;. For purposes of comparison, I have included results from gzip, bzip2 and xz from last time.

          Today I tested out various compression programs that are available on macOS/Linux.
The compression programs used TL;DR: Never mind, take me to Results!
GNU gzip GNU Gzip is the most used and loved compression program in the Linux/macOS world. Originally written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler for the GNU project. It has been the standard compression program used for many years in the open source community, and is a well established standard, not least for tar.

          <p>This is a description of how I  installed Arch on my Mac mini (ultimo 2012) that I purchased very cheaply refurbished. This machine has 16 Gb of RAM and 128 Gb SSD and it was expensive when it was first purchased. It is not possible to upgrade this machine past macOS Catalina, but with Linux the support will continue forever, and this little computer can continue to run a modern, fully secure and updated operating system.</p>

          <p>This is a short guide on how to convert your Bazaar repos to git on
Launchpad, which is Ubuntu&rsquo;s development server. Bazaar was chosen by
Ubuntu as their revision control system, and the developers did a lot
of work on the Bazaar code, which is written in Python. However,
development stopped several years ago, and Bazaar was no longer
maintained. A spinoff project named <a href="https://github.com/breezy-team/breezy">Breezy</a> took over, and is
maintaining the code, now invoked by the commend <code>brz</code> (but with an
alias to former &lsquo;bzr&rsquo;). Anyway, it&rsquo;s time to convert my archives to
git.</p>

          If you have an account on a remote computer that you use very often, it is convienient if you do not have to type your password every time you log on to another host. You can achieve this by using ssh&rsquo;s authorization keys.
First, you need to generate a key-pair. A key-pair consists of two small files. One file contains your secret key, the other your public key. Your secret key is, as the name implies, secret.
