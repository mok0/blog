Tuesday evening (Feb. 8.), the popular tech-review program on Danish
public television channel DR2 “So Ein Ding…” dedicated an entire
episode to Ubuntu. The program host, Nikolaj Sonne, took Ubunto for a
test spin, and gives a very positive, fair and balanced review. His
final verdict ends on 4 out of 6, which is extremely good, especially
considering that an upgrade broke his Maverick installation in the
trials (no trackpad, no keyboard) and he had to downgrade to Lucid.

You can view the episode here — in Danish of course — but watch the
program anyway for the nice graphics.
