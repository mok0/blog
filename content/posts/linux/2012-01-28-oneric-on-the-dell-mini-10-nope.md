A couple of months ago, I downloaded the Ubuntu 11.10 installer and
put it on an USB stick. Judging from the discussions on the net, I
might be one of the only people on the planet who actually *like*
Unity, and I was really looking forward to getting it on my netbook.
In my opinion, Oneiric Ocelot is a terrific release. I have it on my
workstation and I like it a lot.

Unfortunately, the install on my miserable Dell Mini 10 failed. It
dies and freezes. Frustration. I wanted to blog about it, but didn’t
get around it until now. So here is what happens. The following
screenshots were taken with my smartphone, that is the only way I
could make screendumps.

Shortly after the Ubuntu 11.10 screen, with the five dots, the
following appears:

<img src="posts/linux/booting-ubuntu-dell-mini-101-e1327771920203.png" />

After some seconds the purple background color turns black:

<img src="/posts/linux/booting-ubuntu-dell-mini-102-e1327772365829.png">

… and then the booting process shuts down:

<img src="/posts/linux/booting-ubuntu-dell-mini-103-e1327773041467.png" />

I have no idea what’s going on, but it seems to have something to do
with the wireless driver. Next thing to try is to boot while the Dell
Mini 10 is wired to the network.
